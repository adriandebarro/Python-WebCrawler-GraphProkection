Python-WebCrawler-GraphProjection
=================================

Will be able to produce a map representartion of all the links which are found under the domain name 
specified by the user. For this implementation there willl be the use of python along side NetworkX which 
allows the representation of theoretical graphs. 



TO DO list:


1. Web Crawler to search all the links under a given website
2. Implement the NetworkX implementation such that a graph represenation output can be shown
3. Extend further the imoplementation such that the graoph can be shown to grow at realtime along with the
   links found by the webcrawler
